    <h2>What is Vue?</h2>
    <p>
      Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It
      builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative,
      component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any
      complexity.

    <h2>The Progressive Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Vue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features needed in frontend
      development. But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary
      drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and
      incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:

    <div class="list-container">
      <ul>
        <li>Enhancing static HTML without a build step</li>
        <li>Embedding as Web Components on any page</li>
        <li>Single-Page Application (SPA)</li>
        <li>Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</li>
        <li>Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)</li>
        <li>Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Single-File Components</h2>
    <p>
      In most build-tool-enabled Vue projects, we author Vue components using an HTML-like file
      format called Single-File Component (also known as *.vue files, abbreviated as SFC). A Vue
      SFC, as the name suggests, encapsulates the component's logic (JavaScript), template (HTML),
      and styles (CSS) in a single file.
    </p>
    <p>
      SFC is a defining feature of Vue and is the recommended way to author Vue components if your
      use case warrants a build setup. You can learn more about the how and why of SFC in its
      dedicated section - but for now, just know that Vue will handle all the build tools setup for
      you.

    <h2>API Styles</h2>
    <p>
      Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: Options API and Composition API.
